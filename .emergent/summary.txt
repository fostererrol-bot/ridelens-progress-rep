<original_problem_statement>
The user wants to deploy their application, RideLens, as a web app. The application's source code is hosted on a GitHub repository: .

The user has been providing deployment logs from the Emergent Deployments pipeline, which have shown a series of build failures. The primary goal is to debug and fix these deployment issues by making code-level changes and pushing them to the user's GitHub repository, which is the source for the deployment.

After several fixes, the user is now facing a new deployment error related to the  package manager. The user's last request was to push the fix for this  issue.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
- An application named RideLens — Ride Data Insight.
- It transforms ride screenshots into structured data.
- Key features: report comparisons, user-controlled data uploads, dashboards.
- The current, active goal is to successfully deploy it as a web application. The original goal of publishing to the Apple App Store is a future task.
</original_problem_statement>

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The workspace contains the user's RideLens application, a React + Vite project, in the  directory. The application runs correctly in the local environment, managed by a  service.

However, the production deployment is broken. The deployment pipeline pulls code directly from the user's GitHub repository. The agent has gone through several cycles of diagnosing errors from build logs, applying fixes, and pushing them to GitHub. The latest error indicates the build environment is incorrectly trying to use  as a package manager.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: Debugging a deployment failure where the build process was attempting to use  instead of . This was caused by a  file in the repository. The agent correctly identified the issue, deleted the  file locally, and added it to . The user has just requested the agent to push this fix to the GitHub repository.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? NA(if testing is already done)
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: Production Deployment Failure (P0)
  - Issue 2: Broken External Preview URL (P1)
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Description: The production deployment is failing. The latest logs show the error , indicating the build environment is trying to use the  package manager, which is not available. This is caused by the presence of a  file in the source code pulled from GitHub.
     - Attempted fixes: The agent correctly diagnosed the issue and locally deleted  and updated  to prevent it from being committed again. This fix has **not yet been pushed** to the user's GitHub repository.
     - Next debug checklist: 
        1. The agent's immediate next step must be to push the fix to the user's GitHub repository as requested. This involves:
            a. Cloning the repository ().
            b. Deleting the  file.
            c. Updating  to include .
            d. Committing and pushing the changes.
        2. The agent will likely need a new GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) from the user, as the previous ones expired or were invalid.
        3. After the push is successful, the user needs to be instructed to trigger a new deployment.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This is the current primary blocker preventing a successful deployment. Fixing it should allow the build to proceed using the correct package manager.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Is recurring issue? Y (This is the latest in a series of deployment issues).
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: No.
  - Issue 2: 
     - Description: The live preview URL is not working and shows an  error. This happened because the application was migrated from the default Expo template (which has built-in tunneling) to a Vite project. The Vite dev server runs locally but is not exposed to the public internet.
     - Attempted fixes: The agent previously diagnosed the cause but could not find a solution within the environment to expose the Vite server through the platform's tunneling mechanism.
     - Next debug checklist:
        1. This is a platform/infrastructure issue, not a code issue. The code itself is fine.
        2. This is a lower priority than the production deployment. It should be addressed after the deployment is successful.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? Fixing this will restore the live preview functionality, which is helpful for the user to see changes during development.
     - Status:  NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: No.

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1:  Push the  fix to GitHub (P0)
     - Where to resume: The agent needs to start the process of cloning the user's repo, applying the changes (deleting , updating ), and pushing. The agent should be prepared to ask for a new GitHub PAT.
     - What will be achieved with this?: This will resolve the latest deployment error and hopefully lead to a successful build.
     - Status:  NOT STARTED
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: frontend (via new deployment)
     - Blocked on something: Potentially a valid GitHub PAT from the user.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
    Upcoming Tasks:
    - (P0) Finalize and push the fix for the  deployment error.
    - (P1) Guide the user to trigger a new deployment and verify its success.
    - (P2) Address the broken live preview URL if the user still requires it.
    Future Tasks:
    - (P3) Publish the RideLens app to the Apple App Store. This was the original request before the user pivoted to web deployment.

**Completed work in this session**
- List of all completed tasks with file and method name:
    - Migrated the user's Vite-based 'RideLens' app into the  workspace.
    - Configured the local supervisor to run the Vite app ().
    - **Iteratively debugged and fixed multiple deployment errors by pushing changes to the user's GitHub repo:**
        - **Fix 1:** Created  and removed the

**key api endpoints**
- All API endpoints are external, pointing to the user's Supabase project configured in .

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **The immediate and only next step is to push the bun fix to the user's GitHub repository.** The user explicitly requested this ().
- **Deployment Source:** All deployment fixes **MUST** be pushed to the  branch of . Local changes do not affect deployment.
- **GitHub PAT:** The agent has had significant trouble with user-provided Personal Access Tokens (PATs) being invalid or expiring. Be prepared to ask for a **new, classic token with  scope** if the push fails. Do not attempt a Fine-grained token. The last valid token was .
- **Deployment is an iterative process:** The agent has been in a loop of: . This is expected. The current step is pushing the fix for the  error.
- **The Preview URL is broken:** This is a known, lower-priority issue. Do not get sidetracked by it until the deployment is successful.

**documents created in this job**
- A series of iOS publishing guides were created early on but are not relevant to the current task.
-  was created to solve a deployment issue.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User (Msg 130):** push the bun fix now (PENDING)
2.  **User (Msg 127):** how do i summarize ? (COMPLETED)
3.  **User (Msg 124):** Provides new deployment logs showing the  error. (IN PROGRESS)
4.  **User (Msg 112):** Reports app preview - blocked request on the deployed app with an image. (COMPLETED - Fixed by updating )
5.  **User (Msg 102):** Provides a new, valid GitHub PAT (). (COMPLETED)
6.  **User (Msg 100):** Asks for clarification on generating a new token. (COMPLETED)
7.  **User (Msg 90):** Provides an invalid GitHub PAT (). (COMPLETED)
8.  **User (Msg 74):** Provides an expired/invalid GitHub PAT (). (COMPLETED)
9.  **User (Msg 54):** Provides new deployment logs showing the  error. (COMPLETED)
10. **User (Msg 42):** Provides an expired/invalid GitHub PAT. (COMPLETED)

**Project Health Check:**
- **Frontend Code:** Healthy. Runs locally without issues.
- **Frontend Preview:** **Broken**. The external preview URL ( tunnel) is not working.
- **Backend:** Mocked/External. Connects to an external Supabase instance.
- **Deployment:** **Broken**. The last reported deployment attempt failed due to a  package manager error. A fix has been identified but not pushed.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **Supabase:** Used as the backend for authentication and database. Requires user-provided keys found in .
- **GitHub:** Used for version control and is the direct source for the production deployment pipeline.

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created: []
  - Known regressions:
    - The external preview URL functionality was lost after migrating from the initial Expo template to the user's Vite project.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- The agent will require a **new GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)** from the user to push the next fix. The user has provided several, but they often expire or are invalid. The agent must verify the token works or ask for a new one.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent's last instruction from the user, push the bun fix now (Message 130), has not been executed yet. This must be the next agent's first action.
